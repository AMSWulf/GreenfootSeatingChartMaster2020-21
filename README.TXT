
PROJECT TITLE: AP CSA Assignment 1 (An interactive seating chart using Greenfoot)

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this assignment is to visually work with classes and subclasses, abstract classes, and interfaces, and to familiarize yourself with the basics of the GIT command line.  As a side effect, it will help your instructor learn your names!

VERSION or DATE: 07/21/2020
Version 4 (2023-24): 08/15/24

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  To start this project, assuming that you have Greenfoot installed, click on the greenfoot project file within the top level of the assignment directory.  If greenfoot is correctly installed, you will see a green foot icon just to the left of "project".

AUTHORS:                    Mr. Kaehms, Dr. Schick and CSA students

CONTRIBUTERS:               Kilgore Trout
                            (Add you name here once your code 
                             is added and correct)

USER CLONE INSTRUCTIONS:


1) Start git bash (assuming that you are using git bash). 
NOTE: Each class build-master should fork the main repo to a new repo before starting. Names below should be updated accordingly

2) Move to a directory where you want to keep your work. For instance, cd c:/ then cd Users/YourName/Documents/Assignments

3) Clone (first time, each class build-master should fork, so that each class has their own copy) the repository into the directory where git bash is pointing:

    git clone https://github.com/DHS-CP/P3_GreenfootSeatingChartMaster2023-24.git  (this will change based on fork created by build-master(s).

NOTE: This should set up all initial conditions for GIT and avoid a lot of confusion.

4) Open the greenfoot project file from within greenfoot and start editing.

5) Once tested and saved in Greenfoot, from the bash shell add any files that you want to put into the repository to the next git commit: (Note: File names are case sensitive!)

PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT YOUR FILES IF THEY DO NOT COMPILE LOCALLY!!!!! Work with your build master! I will provide the current version of the seating chart in Canvas, so that you know where you should be seated.

FULL USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

*NOTE: YOU MAY NEED TO LOGIN TO GITHUB AT SOME POINT IN THIS PROCESS AND THERE WILL BE A POPUP THAT SHOWS UP WHERE YOU ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

1) navigate to your GitHub directory in the git bash terminal using the command: cd [directory goes here without brackets]

2) then clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/DHS-CP/P3_GreenfootSeatingChartMaster2023-24.git

3) then navigate to the new cloned folder using the command: cd P3_GreenfootSeatingChartMaster2023-24

3) configure your GitHub email by using the commands: git config --global user.email “example@email.com”

4) configure your GitHub username by using the commands: git config --global user.name “exampleUserName”

5) Next open the new cloned folder in Greenfoot and make your edits

Once you are done editing the Greenfoot file do the following steps:

6) create and switch to your local branch using the command: git checkout -b [examplebranchname without brackets]

Run the following commands to push your code

7) git add .

8) git commit -m “descriptive message of the commit”

9) git push --set-upstream origin [examplebranchname without brackets]

Next go to github.com and find the repository P3_GreenfootSeatingChartMaster2023-24 and go to the Pull Request window

Click create a pull request and on the top left of the screen, set your base branch to “main” and set your compare branch to “[examplebranchname without brackets]” 

Then create a pull request and add a title and description to your pull request. Finally, create the pull request and await build masters approval

ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS IN BRIEF

1) Each student needs to create their own student file, and write a method that plays the firstlast.wav file while performing some kind of animation.  Please pronounce your full name clearly
when making your .wav file, as this assignment will be used to learn correct pronunciation of names.

2) Each student must implement one of the abstract classes. See KilgoreTrout.java for an example. Note the "implements" directive in the class declaration.

3) The wav file should state your name, and say one thing true and unique about you (not that you hunt lions in Africa).

4) Each table group must implement at least one method in some other part of the scenario.  Each method of this type must be fully documented so that other students and table groups can use the method, if they want.  You can add methods to the Student, StudentDeskGroup, or even StudentDesk (if you can think of something useful).  There are a couple of suggestions listed in the description section of StudentDeskGroup that you write, or use as ideas.

5) Before you start, each period should agree on a build-master or build-masters, and a workflow that they will use to manage and update the master repository.  Access rights can be assigned to groups, and currently there is a group for each classroom.
(Google "popular GIT workflows).  We will discuss some in class. Before you choose a workflow, you
must particpate in a Canvas online discussion on workflows that will be posted as an assignment.

See the Canvas instructions for a complete set of requirements for this year's project.
